        <p class="lead">Four projects look into modeling evapotranspiration across a continuous spatial surface within the contexts of the HydroData package. Specifically (1) how DAYMET and Weather Underground data can be used to calculate PET at a daily timesteps for North America; (2) how the same process can be applied globally; (4) how values – analogous to the FAO crop coefficients – can be developed for all vegetated Anderson level 2 land covers and (4) how to decouple the effect of temperature on ET rates using observed streamflow records.<p><strong>Working with: </strong>Dami Eyelade, Jeremy Neill, Dino Korac</p>

                      <p class="lead">Three projects look at the feasibility of real-time flood mapping using R and the National Water Model. The first (1) is to develop a system that allows GIS agencies throughout the country to install and run an hourly flood impacts models using the HAND methodology, the second (2) is to evaluate the accuracy of the HAND method against a repository of satellite derived flood extents and the third (3) is develop a filtering scheme to identify abnormally low and high flows in a NWM forecast allowing decision-makers and modelers to focus on areas that need attention.</p>

        <p class="lead">Over the last 25 years the concept of water security has gained in popularity, but its meaning remains ambiguous despite several attempts to articulate a unified definition. This project seeks to better understand water security through a quantitative, text-based analysis of the literature to remove linguistic redundancies and overlap to identify core, timeless agreements.<p><strong>Working with: </strong>Keith Clarke</p>
