<div class="collapse" id="abstract_1"><div class="card card-body"><p>Flood maps are needed for emergency response, research, and planning. The Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique is a low-complexity, terrain-based approach for inundation mapping using elevation data, discharge-height relationships, and streamflow inputs.Â  The recent operational capacities of the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) and pre-processed HAND products from the University of Texas offer an operational framework for real-time and forecast flood guidance across the United States. In this study, we evaluate the NWM-HAND approach using 28 remotely sensed inundation maps and 54 NHD catchments. The results show the NWM-HAND method tends to underpredict inundated cells in lower order reaches (Strahler order &lt;4) and does better with a slight tendency to over predict, in high order reaches. An evaluation of the roughness coefficient used in the derivation of synthetic rating curves suggests it is the most important parameter for improvement in correcting these errors. Persistent inaccuracies do occur when the NWM misses substantially (&gt;60% mean absolute error between NWM and observed flow) and in regions of low relief. While NWM values are taken as input, suggestions for handling areas of low relief are provided. Overall, the NWM-HAND method does a poor job of accurately capturing inundated cells (~20%) but is quite capable of highlight regions likely to be at risk in fourth order streams and higher. While NWM-HAND should be used with caution when identify flood boundary lines or making decisions predicated of whether a cell is dry or wet, its applicability as a high-level guidance tool along larger rivers is noteworthy.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_2"><div class="card card-body"><p>The primary functions in this package are are `geocode`, `revgeocode`, `getAOI`, and `getBoundingBox`.  The first returns a data.frame of coordinates from place names using the OSM API; the second returns a list of descriptive features from a known place name or lat/lon pair; the third returns a spatial (sf) geometry from a country, state, county, or defined region, and the last an extent encompassing a set of input features. Additional helper functions include `bbox_st` and `bbox_sp` which help convert AOIs between string and geometries;  `check` which helps users visualize AOIs in an interactive leaflet map; and `modify` which allows AOIs to be modified by uniform distances.  Finally, `describe`  breaks existing spatial features into `getAOI` parameters to improve the reproducibility of geometry generation. Three core datasets are served with the package. The first contains the spatial geometries and attributes of all `world` countries. The second, the spatial geometries for US `states` and the third contains the same for all US `counties`. See the \href{https://github.com/mikejohnson51/AOI/blob/master/README.md}{README} on github, and the project webpage for examples \href{https://mikejohnson51.github.io/AOI/}{here}.</p></div></div> </td>
