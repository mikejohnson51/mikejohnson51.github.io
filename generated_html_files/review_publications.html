<div class="collapse" id="abstract_1"><div class="card card-body"><p>Water resource management represents one of the clearest interfaces between nature and society. In a world facing greater climate and hydrologic uncertainty, emergent ‘water crises’ are anticipated to pose increasing challenges to human welfare. The term ‘water security’ has come to embody the compound impacts of variable water crises. Yet, despite comprehensive attempts to articulate what it means to be water secure, the term remains ill defined. The lack of an explicit, interdisciplinary understanding hinders the ability to monitor, improve, and measure security and risk in turn challenging the collective research agenda and the operational capacities of governments. We reviewed recent developments in published water security literature using a corpus of 85 definitions containing 546 unique terms. These terms were analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and visual analytics to produce 9 topics that map onto 4 groups. These were termed: supply, quality, human-access, and environment. A fifth underlying group of scale also emerged. A conclusion draws some broad findings from the review of definitions, suggesting that water security research has simultaneously expanded its inclusivity of disciplines while taking more focused meanings to match academic specializations and stakeholder values. Combined, these evolutions have expanded the meaning, context, and use of ‘water security’ to a point that is has become tantamount to overall security. Instead, we hope to show how despite high-level differences, an understanding of supply, quality, human-access, environment and scale can provide the flexibility needed to adapt to new crises and geographic contexts, while also providing focus within the increasingly broad field of tantamount importance.</p></div></div> </td>
