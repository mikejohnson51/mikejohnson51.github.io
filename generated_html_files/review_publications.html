<div class="collapse" id="abstract_1"><div class="card card-body"><p>Water resource management represents one of the clearest interfaces between nature and society. In a world facing greater climate and hydrologic uncertainty, emergent ‘water crises’ are anticipated to pose increasing challenges to human welfare. The term ‘water security’ has come to embody the compound impacts of variable water crises. Yet, despite comprehensive attempts to articulate what it means to be water secure, the term remains ill defined. The lack of an explicit, interdisciplinary understanding hinders the ability to monitor, improve, and measure security and risk in turn challenging the collective research agenda and the operational capacities of governments. We reviewed recent developments in published water security literature using a corpus of 85 definitions containing 546 unique terms. These terms were analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and visual analytics to produce 9 topics that map onto 4 groups. These were termed: supply, quality, human-access, and environment. A fifth underlying group of scale also emerged. A conclusion draws some broad findings from the review of definitions, suggesting that water security research has simultaneously expanded its inclusivity of disciplines while taking more focused meanings to match academic specializations and stakeholder values. Combined, these evolutions have expanded the meaning, context, and use of ‘water security’ to a point that is has become tantamount to overall security. Instead, we hope to show how despite high-level differences, an understanding of supply, quality, human-access, environment and scale can provide the flexibility needed to adapt to new crises and geographic contexts, while also providing focus within the increasingly broad field of tantamount importance.</p></div></div> </td>

A Comprehensive Evaluation of the National Water Model (NWM) - Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) Flood Mapping Methodology.

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_2"><div class="card card-body"><p>Flood maps are needed for emergency response, research, and planning. The Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique is a low-complexity, terrain-based approach for inundation mapping from elevation, discharge-height relationship, and streamflow data.  The recent operational capacities of the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) and pre-processed HAND products from the University of Texas offer an operational framework for real-time and forecast flood mapping across the United States. This paper offers the first detailed evaluation of the coupled NWM-HAND approach by comparing NWM-HAND simulations to a database of remotely sensed flood maps. These comparisons are made both quantitatively and through a detailed evaluation of selected results. The results show that NWM-HAND performs well in the majority of cases with 70% of the calculated flood maps yielding an agreement of 80% or better with the remote sensing observations. Persistent inaccuracies occur in lower-order reaches, regions of low relief, and when the NWM misses substantially either in magnitude or timing.</p></div></div> </td>
