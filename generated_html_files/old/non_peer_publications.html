<div class="collapse" id="abstract_9"><div class="card card-body"><p>In August of 2016, the National Water Model became operational marking an unprecedented effort that rightfully challenges the way research can be done and the way hydro-intelligence can benefit society. This modeling framework has also introduced ways in which interdisciplinary research surrounding water resources can be done. By providing river forecasts for 2.7 million reaches within CONUS, the NWM provides a nerve center in which two previously distinct groups - ‘data generators’ and ‘data users’ - can unite to answer new questions in a time where population pressures and a changing climate make water management more paramount.<br><br>
                      The reports published here represent the culmination of seven weeks of research, and present a platform not only for these students to continue pushing forward with their advisors, each other and the NWC, but for the rest of the community, whether ‘data-generators’ or ‘data-users’, to become more engaged in the development of the NWM.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_13"><div class="card card-body"><p>Present‐day disaster alert systems are underdeveloped in relation to modern forecasting capabilities, geospatial technologies, and telecommunications. Consequently, alerts are often spatially vague, temporally imprecise, and fail to provide actionable information, resulting in confusing warnings that are easily ignored.<br><br>
                    
                      This research describes the integration of predictive models into an Operational Platform for Emergency
                      Response Awareness (OPERA), colloquially known as the “Disaster Zoo”. The Disaster Zoo operates across the initial phases of a disaster event, including preparedness, warning, and response, by capitalizing on social media to promote awareness, leveraging Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to improve spatiotemporal accuracy, and cellular Global Position Systems (GPS) technology to deliver individualized actionable alerts. Currently, the Disaster Zoo showcases alerts for floods, wildfires, and chemical spills; other disaster types may be considered in the future. This research is not intended to be a new approach to emergency response per se, but rather to reimagine emergency alert systems, demonstrate their improvements, and argue for their viability, and indeed, necessity.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_14"><div class="card card-body"><p>Traditional river forecasting and hydraulic modeling is limited by the type, quantity and density of measurements available. Currently, the hydrologic community is reliant on a combination of USGS gages, remotely sensed data, and field work to model the hydrologic properties of a reach. However, if hyper resolution or continent‐scale modeling is undertaken, more data is necessary than the current network can provide. The most obvious way to improve upon this shortcoming is to implement a more densified measurement network; while USGS stations are the industry standard, they are too sparsely located and often not representative of the waterways they are being used to describe. An alternative sensor, the Sommer GmbH RQ‐30 radar, is more cost‐effective, measures both stage and velocity, and operates autonomously. This paper outlines the rationale and objectives behind the installation of these systems, describes two study sites where these instruments have been installed, lays out different methods to gather bathymetry data, and ultimately uses these data, combined with the sensors, to model the reaches.</p></div></div> </td>
