<div class="collapse" id="abstract_1"><div class="card card-body"><p>We review recent developments in cartographic research in North America, in the context of informing the 29th International Cartographic Conference, and 18th General Assembly in 2019. The titles of papers published since 2015 in four leading cartographic journals yielded a corpus of 245 documents containing 1,109 unique terms. These terms were analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and by visual analytics to produce 14 topic groups that mapped onto 5 classes. These classes were named: information visualization, cartographic data, spatial analysis and applications, methods and models, and GIScience. The classes were then used as themes to discuss the recent cartographic literature more broadly first to review recent trends in the research and to identify research gaps, and secondly to examine prospects for new research over the next 20 years. A conclusion draws some broad findings from the review, suggesting that cartographic research in the future will be aimed less at dealing with data, and more at generating insight and knowledge to better inform society about global challenges.</p></div></div> </td>

Managing this data and making it accessible is at the core of maximizing such a modeling system, and NOAA’s aim of providing hydrology as a service. In this paper we introduce an R Shiny web application that allows users to subset, interact, visualize, and download the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) along with current to five day-out streamflow conditions for anywhere in the CONUS. Additionally, the application allows users to compare flow conditions to a modeled monthly average, and identifies regions within the CONUS showing significantly high flow peaks.

As climate variability continues to increase and socio-economic development continues to change the distribution of exposed assets, drought risk is expected to increase in many parts of the world. The unique characteristics of droughts - namely their fuzzy edges, large spatial extent, prolonged temporal bounds, human-influenced propagation, and teleconnection potential – challenge the correct assessment of drought risk. Further complicating such assessment is the ability of humans to make adaptive decisions before, during, and after a drought event, altering the expected impact.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_4"><div class="card card-body"><p>Disasters evolving from hazards are a persistent and deadly occurrence in the United States. Despite this, hazard alerts have remained spatially vague, temporally imprecise, and lack actionable information. These deficiencies indicate a divide between the status quo and what is possible given modern environmental models, geographic information systems (GIS), and smartphone capabilities. This work describes an alternative, prototype system, “FloodHippo,” which integrates operational model outputs, cloud‐based GIS, and expanded communication channels to provide personal and interactive disaster alerts for floods. The precepts and methods underpinning FloodHippo apply equally to other disasters that evolve over space and time, presenting the opportunity for a more intelligent disaster response system. The development of such a system would not only minimize current shortcomings in disaster alerts but also improve resilience through individual action, along with community, academic, and federal cooperation.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_5"><div class="card card-body"><p>A modified Green-and-Ampt model is formulated to quantify infiltration on sloping terrain underlain by homogeneous soil wetted by surficial water application. This paper's theory for quantifying infiltration relies on the mathematical statement of the coupled partial differential equations (pdes) governing infiltration and runoff. These pdes are solved by employing an explicit finite-difference numerical method that yields the infiltration, the infiltration rate, the depth to the wetting front, the rate of runoff, and the depth of runoff everywhere on the slope during external wetting. Data inputs consist of a water application rate or the rainfall hyetograph of a storm of arbitrary duration, soil hydraulic characteristics and antecedent moisture, and the slope's hydraulic and geometric characteristics. The presented theory predicts the effect an advancing wetting front has on slope stability with respect to translational sliding. This paper's theory also develops the 1D pde governing suspended sediment transport and slope degradation caused by runoff influenced by infiltration. Three examples illustrate the application of the developed theory to calculate infiltration and runoff on a slope and their role on the stability of cohesive and cohesionless soils forming sloping terrain.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_6"><div class="card card-body"><p>Shallow translational slides are common in slopes during heavy rainfall. The classic model for the occurrence of translational slides in long slopes assumes rising saturation above a slip surface that reduces the frictional strength by decreasing the effective stress along soil discontinuities. The classic model for translational slope failure does not conform well to the nature of homogenous soils that do not exhibit discontinuities propitious to create perched groundwater over the soil discontinuity or slip surface. This paper develops an alternative methodology for the coupled numerical simulation of runoff and infiltration caused by variable rainfall falling on a slope. The advancing depth of infiltration is shown to affect the translational stability of long slopes subjected to rainfall, without assuming the perching of soil water over the slip surface. This new model offers an alternative mechanism for the translational stability of slopes that are saturated from the slope surface downwards. A computational example illustrates this paper’s methodology.</p></div></div> </td>

                      Response Awareness (OPERA), colloquially known as the “Disaster Zoo”. The Disaster Zoo operates across the initial phases of a disaster event, including preparedness, warning, and response, by capitalizing on social media to promote awareness, leveraging Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to improve spatiotemporal accuracy, and cellular Global Position Systems (GPS) technology to deliver individualized actionable alerts. Currently, the Disaster Zoo showcases alerts for floods, wildfires, and chemical spills; other disaster types may be considered in the future. This research is not intended to be a new approach to emergency response per se, but rather to reimagine emergency alert systems, demonstrate their improvements, and argue for their viability, and indeed, necessity.</p></div></div> </td>

<div class="collapse" id="abstract_12"><div class="card card-body"><p>Traditional river forecasting and hydraulic modeling is limited by the type, quantity and density of measurements available. Currently, the hydrologic community is reliant on a combination of USGS gages, remotely sensed data, and field work to model the hydrologic properties of a reach. However, if hyper resolution or continent‐scale modeling is undertaken, more data is necessary than the current network can provide. The most obvious way to improve upon this shortcoming is to implement a more densified measurement network; while USGS stations are the industry standard, they are too sparsely located and often not representative of the waterways they are being used to describe. An alternative sensor, the Sommer GmbH RQ‐30 radar, is more cost‐effective, measures both stage and velocity, and operates autonomously. This paper outlines the rationale and objectives behind the installation of these systems, describes two study sites where these instruments have been installed, lays out different methods to gather bathymetry data, and ultimately uses these data, combined with the sensors, to model the reaches.</p></div></div> </td>
