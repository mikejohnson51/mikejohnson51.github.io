 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>With rapid progress being made towards continental scale hydrologic models, there is a need to evaluate performance across large domains in a way that not only describes model skill but also error structure and error type. One model that is pushing the boundaries of current modeling capacities, is the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) which integrates real-time weather forecasts, a high resolution (1km) Land Surface Model and a multi-resolution surface routing model to provide hourly streamflow forecasts at 2.7 million locations across the continental US. Now in version 2.0 the NWM is producing stable forecasts but, to date, has had no public evaluation. While traditional evaluation metrics can describe model skill at any given location, they cannot offer the insights that are critical for model improvement and determining use-case suitability. Moreover, traditional model evaluations focus on natural basins at the expense of the more dominate, controlled basins found in continental domains. Here we present a framework for evaluating the daily, 26-year NWM reanalysis streamflow record in 581 natural, and 2,493 controlled basins by decomposing the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) into overall agreement, conditional, and unconditional bias. Each error term was evaluated in the contexts of geographic, hydroclimatic, anthropogenic, and basin characteristics, and clear spatial patterns regarding performance emerged. The discussion synthesizes these findings, and a simple - yet effective - post processing routine is demonstrated that substantially reduces, if not eliminates, the conditional and unconditional error in a sample of basins with extremely high bias.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>In 2016, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed the NWM in real-time operations to forecast streamflow for each of the 2.7 million river segments in the continental USA (CONUS). With each version of the NWM, a multi-decadal historical simulation is made available as hourly files containing “snapshots” of CONUS for any given hour. This file structure makes accessing time series for a location - or set of locations - a technical and resource-intensive challenge. To illustrate, finding a complete 26-year times series for a single river segment requires the download and management of over 227,916 files and 4.1 TB of data.  Here we describe how versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the historic simulations have been restructured and optimized for time series extraction. These datasets have been made accessible via an OPeNDAP enabled THREDDS Data Server and an R package written to expedite data retrieval. The result of this effort is a performant and accessible 26-year, hourly, simulated streamflow record for every river segment in CONUS.</p></div>
