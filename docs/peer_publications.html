 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>This study investigated the spatial consistency of the SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model using a massive data set. The research asks whether SLEUTH can yield both a reliable forecast of land use in the state of California for the year 2100 CE, and an assessment of the forecast's reliability. Data were prepared, and SLEUTH calibrated for 174 tiles made by partitioning the data within the 6 California State Plane Zones. A null hypothesis that all data divisions of California would give similar calibration outcomes so that a uniform simulated rate of growth would apply to statewide future simulations was proven false by mapping and Moran's I values. Spatial autocorrelation was found to propagate forward into the SLEUTH forecasts, resulting in major differences within the state in land use change and change rates. We also explored the spatial distribution of the rules that changed pixels between land use classes, finding that almost 99% of forecast growth in California comes from outward spread from new and existing settlements. The paper concludes with an examination of the uncertainty inherent within, and displayed by the SLEUTH forecasts.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>In Eastern Africa, increasing climate variability and changing socioeconomic conditions are exacerbating the frequency and intensity of drought disasters. Droughts pose a severe threat to food security in this region, which is characterized by a large dependency on smallholder rain-fed agriculture and a low level of technological development in the food production systems. Future drought risk will be determined by the adaptation choices made by farmers, yet few drought risk models … incorporate adaptive behavior in the estimation of drought risk. Here, we present an innovative dynamic drought risk adaptation model, ADOPT, to evaluate the factors that influence adaptation decisions and the subsequent adoption of measures, and how this affects drought risk for agricultural production. ADOPT combines socio-hydrological and agent-based modeling approaches by coupling the FAO crop model AquacropOS with a behavioral model capable of simulating different adaptive behavioral theories. In this paper, we compare the protection motivation theory, which describes bounded rationality, with a business-as-usual and an economic rational adaptive behavior. The inclusion of these scenarios serves to evaluate and compare the effect of different assumptions about adaptive behavior on the evolution of drought risk over time. Applied to a semi-arid case in Kenya, ADOPT is parameterized using field data collected from 250 households in the Kitui region and discussions with local decision-makers. The results show that estimations of drought risk and the need for emergency food aid can be improved using an agent-based approach: we show that ignoring individual household characteristics leads to an underestimation of food-aid needs. Moreover, we show that the bounded rational scenario is better able to reflect historic food security, poverty levels, and crop yields. Thus, we demonstrate that the reality of complex human adaptation decisions can best be described assuming bounded rational adaptive behavior; furthermore, an agent-based approach and the choice of adaptation theory matter when quantifying risk and estimating emergency aid needs.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>The Mainstems data model implements the catchment and flowpath concepts from WaterML2 Part 3: Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) for persistent, cross-scale, identification of hydrologic features. The data model itself provides a focused and lightweight method to describe hydrologic networks with minimum but sufficient information. The design is intended to provide a model for data integration that can be used for network navigation and persistent hydrologic indexing (hydrographic addressing) functionality. Mainstems is designed to provide long-term stability with minimal maintenance requirements. The data model is not meant to advance hydrologic process representation or uniquely represent geomorphic characteristics. The principle assumption in Mainstems is that all drainage basins have one - and only one - headwater source area and a single mainstem that flows to a single outlet. Using these base feature types, (headwater, outlet, mainstem, and drainage basin) a nested set of drainage basins - and the associated dendritic network of mainstems - can be identified.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>The raster data structure stores categorical and continuous field data for spatial analysis, environmental modeling, and resource planning. With rapidly advancing sensor networks, the spatial resolution of data is increasing, sometimes outpacing the optimum resolution for  analyses. Overcoming granularity differences between raw and “analysis ready” data often requires upscaling source data to a desired target map with the goal of maintaining the structure and spatial variance of the higher resolution data.  Current techniques for resampling categorical data (nearest neighbor and majority rule) force users to choose between preserving map structure and map variety. A new method is presented here that integrates the global percentage of each category from the source data and zonal proportions within the target map to guide the optimal allocation of classified cells. This technique provides more representative maps with respect to variety and structure; better retains minority classes; and produces higher (or equal) levels of user’s and producer’s accuracy than the traditional methods. Lastly, an R-based implementation is provided that has serviceable run times, and the performance of the algorithm is shown to be scalable, proving the tool widely usable.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Flood maps are needed for emergency response, research, and planning. The Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique is a low-complexity, terrain-based approach for inundation mapping using elevation data, discharge-height relationships, and streamflow inputs.  The recent operational capacities of the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) and pre-processed HAND products from the University of Texas offer an operational framework for real-time and forecast flood guidance across the United States. In this study, we evaluate the NWM-HAND approach using 28 remotely sensed inundation maps and 54 NHD catchments. The results show the NWM-HAND method tends to underpredict inundated cells in lower order reaches (Strahler order &lt;4) and does better with a slight tendency to over predict, in high order reaches. An evaluation of the roughness coefficient used in the derivation of synthetic rating curves suggests it is the most important parameter for improvement in correcting these errors. Persistent inaccuracies do occur when the NWM misses substantially (&gt;60% mean absolute error between NWM and observed flow) and in regions of low relief. While NWM values are taken as input, suggestions for handling areas of low relief are provided. Overall, the NWM-HAND method does a poor job of accurately capturing inundated cells (~20%) but is quite capable of highlight regions likely to be at risk in fourth order streams and higher. While NWM-HAND should be used with caution when identify flood boundary lines or making decisions predicated of whether a cell is dry or wet, its applicability as a high-level guidance tool along larger rivers is noteworthy.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Droughts are a persistent and costly hazard impacting human and environmental systems. As climate variability continues to increase and socioeconomic development influences the distribution of wealth and people, drought risk is expected to increase in many parts of the world. The unique characteristics of droughts—namely their slow onset, large spatiotemporal extent, human‐influenced propagation, delayed impacts and teleconnection potential—make it difficult to correctly assess drought impact and calculate risk. Further complicating this calculation is the capacity for humans to make adaptive decisions before, during, and after a drought event, which in turn alters expected impacts. In this sense, droughts are equally a social and hydroclimatic issue. Risk perception is one of the main factors driving adaptation decisions, yet most models neglect how humans view and respond to risk, and in particular how experiences influence decisions through time. In this overview, we describe a framework that extends the traditional risk modeling approach to include the two‐way feedback between the transient adaptation decisions and drought exposure, vulnerability and hazard. We discuss how a sociohydrologic, agent‐based modeling setup, focused on individual and collective actions, can simulate the adaptive behaviors of different stakeholders to examine how emergent actions might influence projected drought risk. We suggest such an approach can provide a test‐bed for understanding adaptive behaviors in an increasingly drought‐prone world and could allow for better prioritization of drought adaptation strategies; refined understanding of future scenarios; and a vehicle to drive planning and resilience building.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>We review recent developments in cartographic research in North America, in the context of informing the 29th International Cartographic Conference, and 18th General Assembly in 2019. The titles of papers published since 2015 in four leading cartographic journals yielded a corpus of 245 documents containing 1,109 unique terms. These terms were analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and by visual analytics to produce 14 topic groups that mapped onto 5 classes. These classes were named: information visualization, cartographic data, spatial analysis and applications, methods and models, and GIScience. The classes were then used as themes to discuss the recent cartographic literature more broadly first to review recent trends in the research and to identify research gaps, and secondly to examine prospects for new research over the next 20 years. A conclusion draws some broad findings from the review, suggesting that cartographic research in the future will be aimed less at dealing with data, and more at generating insight and knowledge to better inform society about global challenges.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Disasters evolving from hazards are a persistent and deadly occurrence in the United States. Despite this, hazard alerts have remained spatially vague, temporally imprecise, and lack actionable information. These deficiencies indicate a divide between the status quo and what is possible given modern environmental models, geographic information systems (GIS), and smartphone capabilities. This work describes an alternative, prototype system, “FloodHippo,” which integrates operational model outputs, cloud‐based GIS, and expanded communication channels to provide personal and interactive disaster alerts for floods. The precepts and methods underpinning FloodHippo apply equally to other disasters that evolve over space and time, presenting the opportunity for a more intelligent disaster response system. The development of such a system would not only minimize current shortcomings in disaster alerts but also improve resilience through individual action, along with community, academic, and federal cooperation.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>A modified Green-and-Ampt model is formulated to quantify infiltration on sloping terrain underlain by homogeneous soil wetted by surficial water application. This paper's theory for quantifying infiltration relies on the mathematical statement of the coupled partial differential equations (pdes) governing infiltration and runoff. These pdes are solved by employing an explicit finite-difference numerical method that yields the infiltration, the infiltration rate, the depth to the wetting front, the rate of runoff, and the depth of runoff everywhere on the slope during external wetting. Data inputs consist of a water application rate or the rainfall hyetograph of a storm of arbitrary duration, soil hydraulic characteristics and antecedent moisture, and the slope's hydraulic and geometric characteristics. The presented theory predicts the effect an advancing wetting front has on slope stability with respect to translational sliding. This paper's theory also develops the 1D pde governing suspended sediment transport and slope degradation caused by runoff influenced by infiltration. Three examples illustrate the application of the developed theory to calculate infiltration and runoff on a slope and their role on the stability of cohesive and cohesionless soils forming sloping terrain.</p></div>

 <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Shallow translational slides are common in slopes during heavy rainfall. The classic model for the occurrence of translational slides in long slopes assumes rising saturation above a slip surface that reduces the frictional strength by decreasing the effective stress along soil discontinuities. The classic model for translational slope failure does not conform well to the nature of homogenous soils that do not exhibit discontinuities propitious to create perched groundwater over the soil discontinuity or slip surface. This paper develops an alternative methodology for the coupled numerical simulation of runoff and infiltration caused by variable rainfall falling on a slope. The advancing depth of infiltration is shown to affect the translational stability of long slopes subjected to rainfall, without assuming the perching of soil water over the slip surface. This new model offers an alternative mechanism for the translational stability of slopes that are saturated from the slope surface downwards. A computational example illustrates this paper’s methodology.</p></div>
